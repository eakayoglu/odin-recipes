    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everybody wants this recipe for chocolate chip cookies when I bring them anywhere to share. They are even award-winning. My daughter, Tegan, made them for a cookie baking contest and won a red ribbon! You can use any flavor pudding you like for this recipe.</p>
    <p><strong>Allstar Review:</strong> "I made only half of the recipe and got 18 cookies using a medium cookie scoop. They spread quite a bit so next time I will refrigerate the dough prior to baking the cookies. A little too soft for my taste but otherwise pretty tasty." — Yolanda Gutierrez</p>
